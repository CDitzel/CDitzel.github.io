[This publication shows a way to probabilistically construct camera views
based on nothing but but synchronized radar data. This allows to maintain a
clear and informative impression of the environment for the control of
autonomous systems and offers interesting possibilities for both application and
academia.](https://cditzel.github.io/GenRadar/)
