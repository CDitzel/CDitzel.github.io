This publication is the result of a research semester of mine at the [Royal
Institute of Technology (KTH)](https://www.kth.se/en) within the [Department of
Solid Mechanics](https://www.hallf.kth.se/en) back in 2014. It deals with the
numerical contact calculation of stent deployments for the treatment of
Abdominal aortic aneurysm. Realistic computational simulations applied to the
medical field, have the potential to circumvent dangerous in-vivo test runs and
can exclude possible life-threatening risks from the start. You can find the
paper [here](/assets/img/aaa_paper_ditzel.pdf), alongside some Matlab code which
was used to facilitate the simulations.
