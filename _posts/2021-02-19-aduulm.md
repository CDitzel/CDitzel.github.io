This [BMVC publication](https://www.bmvc2020-conference.com/assets/papers/0474.pdf)
of my colleagues and me attempts to close the gap that existed for annotated
datasets in the context of autonomous driving in adverse weather and compromised
lighting. It features multitudes of challenging real-world driving scenarios in
and around the city of Ulm-Germany and was recorded during the course of several
seasons. It includes sequences with heavy fog, snow rain and also captures
various lighting conditions which are challenging for modern vehicular sensor
setups such as glaring and blooming effects as well as recordings at different
daylight conditions. The annotations comprise 12 semantic classes (car, truck,
bus, motorbike, pedestrian, bicyclist, traffic-sign, traffic-light, road,
sidewalk, pole, unlabeled) and can be used for both semantic segmentation
approaches as well as free-space detection methods.

Sensor setup:
- Camera (telephoto lens, wide-angle lens),
- Lidars (16/32 lines),
- Stereo Camera footage,
- GPS data,
- IMU recordings
