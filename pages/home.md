Project page for my latest paper [GENRADAR: SELF-SUPERVISED PROBABILISTIC CAMERA SYNTHESIS BASED
ON RADAR FREQUENCIES](https://cditzel.github.io/GenRadar/) is up. Please let me know what you think.

My passion is in the field of self-learning neural systems applied to low-level
sensor data. The basic idea is to let the algorithms find patterns and
correlations without manual procesisng or human interference. This allows for
the exploitation of an unprecedented amount of information and makes the environment
perception for autonomous systems, especially in adverse environments, more reliable.
