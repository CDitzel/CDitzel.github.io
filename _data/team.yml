    I was born in the former German capital Bonn, Germany, in 1986. After my
    Abitur (High School diploma) in 2005, I worked for one year as a volunteer on the cancer ward of
    the Asklepios children's hospital in Sankt Augustin, Germany. Afterwards I studied
    mechatronic engineering and received the Diploma degree (equivalent to
    M.Sc. degree) from the University of Applied Sciences Bonn-Rhein-Sieg,
    Germany, in 2010. Having discovered my passion for mathematical simulation
    and numerical optimization, I subsequently enrolled in a computational
    engineering Masters's programme at the University of Hanover, Germany. In
    2015 I graduated with honors and in 2016 became a research assistant and
    Ph.D. candidate at the Institute of Measurement, Control and
    Microtechnology, School of Engineering and Computer Science, at Ulm
    University. Here my passion and focus of research is in the field of
    low-level multimodal sensor fusion for the reliable environment perception
    in adverse weather and compromised environmental circumstances.
